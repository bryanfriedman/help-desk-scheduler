<h2>2.4. Details of Account Privileges</h2>

<p>There are three types of accounts:</p>

<ul>
 <li><b>Administrator</b> accounts are used by Help Desk Staff members to create, generate, and modify schedules, as well as for managing accounts, priorities, and schedule rules.
  <ul>
   <li>There is a main Administrator account called "admin" which has a default password of "password".  This is the "super-user" administrator account.  It cannot be deleted and nothing about it can be changed except for the password and e-mail address.  It should not generally be used as each administrator should have his/her own private account.  This root account is used if other administrators need to reset their own password.  (If all administrator passwords are forgotten, the system may need to be completely reset.)</li>
  </ul>
 <li><b>Lead</b> Student accounts are for lead student assistants at the Help Desk.  Not only does this distinguish that the student is a lead for scheduling purposes, a Lead Student account also has slightly more privileges than a regular student account, but otherwise has all the same functionality.
  <ul>
   <li>Lead Student accounts may add and edit non-administrator accounts, but may not delete any accounts.  In other words, lead students can create accounts for newly highered employees, and lead students may also change passwords or e-mail addresses of current employees.  They may not, however, delete any accounts or change passwords or e-mails of any administrator account.  The purpose of such privileges is to take some burden off of administrators when it comes to password changes and account creations.
   </li>
  </ul>
 <li><b>Student</b> accounts are accounts for non-lead student assistants at the Help Desk.  Student accounts can only change his/her own password.  Students may enter his/her own preferences and view schedules.
 </ul>

</ul>
