<p>The fields are as follows:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The "Date" field is where the date that needs adjusting should be entered.  the "..." button may be pressed to select a date from the calendar pop-up to populate that field.
 <li>The "Start Time" and "End Time" fields are pull-down menus that specify the starting and ending time of the shift that is being entered.
 <li>The "Employee Name" field specifies the name of the employee that will work this shift.  This is a pull-down menu and contains the names of all employees in the system.
 <li>Finally, the "Repeat" field contains a checkbox for each day of the week.  The day of the week of the date in the "Date" field will be checked automatically (but can be unchecked) and other days can be selected where this shift should be repeated.
</ul>

<p>The "Submit" button will make the change to the schedule and return to the main home page.  The "Cancel" and "Reset" buttons work as usual.</p>
