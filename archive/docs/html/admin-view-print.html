<h2>2.2.6. Viewing/Printing a Schedule</h2>

<p>When the "View/Print" button is pressed on the menu, the following screen appears in the content frame:</p>

<p>The first field is for selecting which schedule to view.  The second is for choosing the week of the schedule.  This should be the Monday of the week the user wishes to view.  The third field is for selecting the "type" of schedule to view, either "Master" or "Individual".  The master schedule shows the schedule with every employee included, while the individual schedule is for a specific employee.  The fourth field is for selecting how to view the schedule, in "Detail" mode or in "Tabular" mode.  Detail mode is only available for individual schedules, so if "Individual" is selected, this field will be grayed out.  Finally, if "Individual" is selected the last field will be enabled, allowing the user to select which employee's schedule to view (for administrators only).  If "Master" is chosen, this field is grayed out.  After clicking "View" one of the views as described below will appear based on the options chosen.  The "Cancel" button works as usual.</p>

<p>The two ways of viewing schedules are "Detail" which looks like this:</p>

<p>and "Tabular", which is probably the more commonly chosen way to view the schedule.  This way is shown in the following image as the "Master" schedule, but the idea is similar for "Individual" schedules as well.</p>

<p>By clicking on the day headers, a tabular view of that particular day can be seen as follows:</p>

<p>Any "Print" button will print the schedule as shown.</p>

<p>The default view shown on the main home page of the schedule is the Master Tabular schedule.  There is a "Print" button on that page as well, but only if a user is logged in.</p>
