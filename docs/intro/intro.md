## 1. Introduction

The Help Desk Scheduler is a web-based application that provides functions for maintaining a work schedule at the Help Desk. Staff members use the Help Desk Scheduler to generate and modify schedules, while student assistants use it to submit schedule preferences and request/respond to shift cover. It also provides functionality for viewing and printing schedules in various formats.

The Help Desk Scheduler is specifically designed for use at the Cal Poly ITS Help Desk, but may be extended for use in other departments on campus or even small companies.

### 1.1. Problem Statement

The general problems solved by the Help Desk Scheduler are the following:

- to provide a schedule generation tool that automatically creates a schedule based on user preferences and settings
- to provide a means of administering user accounts for logging into the scheduler
- to provide a means of viewing and printing a particular schedule

### 1.2. System Personnel

The personnel involved in the Help Desk Scheduler project are organized into the following groups and subgroups:

1. End Users
   - Help Desk Staff
   - Help Desk Lead Students
   - Help Desk Students
2. System Developers
3. Other Campus Departments Staff and Students
4. Other Small Companies

End users are the people who use the scheduler because of its functionality. Help Desk staff members are the main users and also, the administrator for the Help Desk Scheduler. Lead students and student assistants use the scheduler to submit schedule preferences and interact with the schedule in various ways. All users may view or print schedules.

The primary system developer is Bryan Friedman, under the guidance of the project advisor, Dr. Joe Grimes, and former Help Desk Lead Student, Michael Abraham.

### 1.3. Operational Setting

The operational setting for the Help Desk Scheduler is by use as a normal software system by Help Desk students and staff members.

### 1.4. Impacts

**Positive impacts:**

*For Help Desk staff:* Staff members can generate schedules and communicate about schedules with the students more efficiently, thus utilizing time more productively.

*For Help Desk students:* The Help Desk Scheduler provides an easier interface for students to communicate schedule concerns to supervisors and other students. It also allows them to view and print schedules from anywhere since the application is web-based.

**Negative impacts:**

If the Help Desk Scheduler user interface or schedule-generating algorithm is poorly designed, the instructor may spend more time and effort to modify and change the schedule than it would take to do create it manually.

If security is not designed well enough, it may be possible for a student to gain access to parts of the system that only staff members should have access to.

### 1.5. Related Systems

Tools that provide similar functionality to the Test Tool include:

- [Work Schedule DOT NET](http://workschedule.net/)
- [ScheduleSource](http://www.schedulesource.com/)

While both of these tools are indeed web-based, they offer quite a bit more functionality than is needed by the small establishment at the Help Desk. They also cost money and there is no room in the Help Desk budget for such a tool, especially since the commercial tools are much bigger than the Help Desk needs.

The Help Desk Scheduler surpasses these systems in the following areas:

- ability to include lead student assistants as well as regular student assistants
- ability to allow students to communicate and cover shifts
- ability to include student interface (i.e. class schedule input)

The goals for the Help Desk relating to public domain source code and sound pedagogical development are not met by any of the above systems.
