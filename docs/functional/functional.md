## 2. Functional Requirements

The primary functionality of Help Desk Scheduler is for administrators to be able to generate and manage schedules. Students have an interface that is used for entering priorities and shift cover requests. All accounts can view and print schedules.

Following an [overview of the Help Desk Scheduler front page](front.md), details of system use are presented in the following sections:

- [Administrator Page](administrator/administrator.md)
- [Employee Page](employee/employee.md)
- [Details of Account Privileges](privileges/privileges.md)

These sections cover all the functional requirements for the system.
