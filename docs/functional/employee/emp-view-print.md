## 2.3.4. Viewing/Printing a Schedule

Viewing and printing schedules for employees works just the same as for administrators except that when the "Individual" option is chosen, the only schedule that can be seen is the user who is logged in.

See [Section 2.2.6](../administrator/admin-view-print.md) for the way in which administrators view and print schedules.
